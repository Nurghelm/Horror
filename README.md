# Horror
Augmented Reality GPS mobile game

A game based on GPS games like the Parallel games (kingdom and mafia), Ingress, and the new PokemonGo. 

This game will be horror themed with AR elements designed to scare players or let players engage in "boss fights". 
The bulk of the game will be a map based GPS/AR game, the game will be asymetric with two different kinds of players that interact with the world in different ways. 
The game will have some Rogue-Like elements involved with players being able to have "characters" of theirs permakilled. 
The "Player" will level up independently of the player's "Characters". 
The "Player" will never die and will unlock more "Character" options the more they play.
